# Microsoft low-code application development solutions for Microsoft Teams (DRAFT)

Microsoft Teams is both extensible and customizable meaning you can build custom applications for Teams to meet the distinct needs of your users. Low-code development platforms allow citizen developers to quickly build custom apps and professional developers to accelerate app development and deployment.

You most likely know Microsoft Teams as a hub for collaboration and productivity – but did you know that it is also an extensible and customisable platform? The combination of Microsoft Teams and Power Platform means you can build custom applications, automations and chat bots for Teams in a low-code environment, rapidly developing solutions that suit the needs of your users, and enabling them to use them right where they already work.

•	Rapidly deliver apps that your business needs with the existing talent
•	Improve developer productivity with low-code attributes, such as a development toolkit (based on developer experience), a visual user interface, reusable components, and more
•	Enable faster decision making among cross-functional teams with baked-in collaboration tools
Low-code is a new approach to building unique business applications – fast. With a low-code development platform, you don’t code an application line-by-line, you draw it -- like a flowchart. This makes developing powerful new applications quick and intuitive.

Low-code is a software development approach that enables the delivery of applications faster and with minimal hand-coding. 

Low-code and no-code application development platforms
Here’s what a typical low-code development platform looks like:
•	A visual IDE: An environment for visually defining the UIs, workflows, and data models of your application and, where necessary, adding hand-written code.
•	Connectors to various back-ends or services: Automatically handles data structures, storage, and retrieval.
•	Application lifecycle manager: Automated tools to build, debug, deploy, and maintain the application in test, staging, and production.
Low-code is a software development approach that requires little to no coding in order to build applications and processes. A low-code development platform uses visual interfaces with simple logic and drag-and-drop features instead of extensive coding languages. These intuitive tools allow users with no formal knowledge of coding or software development to create applications for many purposes like mobile apps and business apps.
These platforms have become increasingly popular as a fast and easy alternative to traditional software development. Both professional developers and “citizen developers” (non-professional developers) can use a low-code platform to create apps of varying complexity to meet business demands for development, automate processes, and accelerate digital transformation.

Low-code is a well-defined category of application development platforms designed to make application developers faster and more productive. No-code is more like a feature of low-code where visual techniques are used to develop parts, or the whole, of an application.

Depending on the features of the platform being used and the overall system requirements, the developer may or may not have to augment the design with some good old-fashioned code, or the platform may produce an entire working solution with no additional code required.
