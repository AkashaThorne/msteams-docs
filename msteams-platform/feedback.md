# Send feedback about the Microsoft Teams developer platform

The Microsoft Team product team responds to the developer community across several channels.

- **Non programming questions**: GitHub msteams-docs issue list is our main hub for any bugs, API request, general questions, feedbacks and any non-programming questions. We regularly monitor the issue list and provide prompt response. You can [open an issue here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/msteams-docs/issues). 

- **Programming questions:** We listen and respond on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoft-teams). Follow the [guidance](http://stackoverflow.com/tour) about what makes a good question on Stack Overflow. Tag your question with `microsoft-teams` so that our team and the Microsoft Teams developer community can spot your question.

- **Feature requests:** If our platform doesn't empower you to do what you need, please make your features suggestions on the [Microsoft Teams feedback portal on UserVoice](https://aka.ms/microsoftteamsplatformsuggestions).

- **Contributions:** We accept pull requests against the Microsoft Teams JavaScript library, documentation, and samples. If you'd like to contribute, please see the contributor's guide in each repo.
