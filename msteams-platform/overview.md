# What are Microsoft Teams apps?

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather and work.

Apps are how you integrate Teams with your favorite features and functionality in other apps and services. You also can create standalone apps that simply extend what Teams already does to fit your needs.

## What can Teams apps do?

People discover and use Teams apps through a set of capabilities, including tabs, messaging extensions, and bots, among others. Your app can use one or a combination of Teams capabilities.

Some apps are simple (send notifications), while others are complex (view patient records). When planning your app, remember that Teams is a collaboration hub. The best Teams apps help people express themselves and work better together.

### Make your information more accessible

Sometimes you just need to make things easier to find. Display an important webpage in a [tab](tabs/design/tabs.md), which provides a full-screen web experience for static and dynamic information in Teams.

### Collaborate on everything in one place

A core benefit of Teams apps is pulling information somewhere outside Teams into a conversation. For example, an app that uses [messaging extensions](messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md) allows people to share rich, easily digestible content from an essential tool or system without leaving the Teams chat.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Talk leads to action

Conversations often result in the need to do something (create an order, review my code, etc.). A [bot](bots/what-are-bots.md) can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

### Send reminders people notice

Sick of sending reminders through email? Do it through Teams instead! Send notifications to individuals, a channel, the Activity Feed, or anyone who subscribes to them with [connectors](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md).

### Automate Teams management  

With the [Microsoft Graph API for Teams](graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent.md), you can automatically create teams and channels, deploy apps, and more.

## Get started

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::

      <div align="center">

      :::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-placeholder.png" alt-text="<alt text>":::
      
        <b>Off and running</b>

        Get to know your way around the platform by creating a basic Teams app.

        > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
        > [Build your first app now](code-in-docs.md)

      </div>

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="":::

      <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-placeholder.png" alt-text="<alt text>":::
      
        <b>Take it slow</b>

        Walk through how to plan, design, build, and deploy a Teams app from scratch.

        > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
        > [Start planning your app](planning-your-app-overview.md)

      </div>

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="":::

      <div align="center">

      :::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-placeholder.png" alt-text="<alt text>":::
      
        <b>Go with what works</b>

        Bring your favorite web app into Teams for a more seamless user experience.

        > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
        > [Integrate an existing app](code-in-docs.md)

      </div>
