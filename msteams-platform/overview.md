# What are Microsoft Teams apps?

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather and work.

Apps are how you integrate Teams with your favorite features and functionality in other apps and services. You also can create standalone apps that simply extend what Teams already does to fit your needs.

## What can Teams apps do?

People discover and use Teams apps through a set of capabilities, including tabs, messaging extensions, bots, and connectors. Your app can have one or a combination of Teams capabilities. You can specify your app's scope for only personal workspaces or expand it to group chats and team activities.

Some apps are simple (send notifications), while others are complex (view patient records). When planning your app, remember that Teams is a collaboration hub. The best Teams apps help people express themselves and work better together.

### Get information more conveniently

Sometimes you just need to make things easier to find. Display an important webpage in a [tab](tabs/what-are-tabs.md), which provides a full-screen web experience for static and dynamic information in Teams.

### Collaborate on everything in one place

A core benefit of Teams apps is pulling information somewhere outside Teams into a conversation. For example, an app that uses [messaging extensions](messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md) allows people to share rich, easily digestible content from an essential tool or system without leaving the Teams chat.

:::row-end:::

### Turn words into actions

Conversations often result in the need to do something (create an order, review my code, etc.). A [bot](bots/what-are-bots.md) can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

### Send reminders people notice

Sick of sending reminders through email? Do it through Teams instead! Send notifications to individuals, a channel, the Activity Feed, or anyone who subscribes to them with [connectors](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md).

### Automate and manage activity

The [Microsoft Graph REST API for Teams](graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent.md) gives your apps increased power and flexibility. For example, an app can build teams automatically based on some user input. Admin apps can help with a variety of management tasks, including governance, security, usage data, and sentiment analysis.
