# What are Microsoft Teams apps?

With the Microsoft Teams platform, you can create apps that bring key information, favorite tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather and work.

## What exactly can Teams apps do?

A Microsoft Teams app can be simple (post notifications in a channel) or complex (a patient care system). When planning your app, remember that Teams is a collaboration hub. The best Teams apps help people express themselves and work better together.

* **Collaborate on everything in the same place**: A core benefit of Teams apps is pulling information somewhere outside Teams into a conversation. For example, your app can help people retrieve data in another tool or share rich, easily digestible content without ever leaving Teams.

* **More talk, more action**: Conversations often result in the need to do something (create an order, review my code, etc.). Your app can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

* **Notify others of important events**: Sick of sending reminders through email? Send notifications in Teams instead! Send notifications directly to users, a channel, the Activity Feed, or to anyone who subscribes to them.

* **Embed other sites and services**: Sometimes you just need to make things easier to find. Simply display your existing single-page app or webpage in Teams.

## How do people use Teams apps?

Apps are for personal or team-wide use. People discover and use apps through a set of Teams capabilities, including tabs, messaging extensions, and bots. You can build your app with one or all of these capabilities.
