# What are Microsoft Teams apps?

With the Microsoft Teams platform, you can create apps that bring key information, favorite tools, and trusted processes where people increasingly gather and work.

## What exactly can Teams apps do?

Apps let you integrate Teams with features and functionality in other apps and services. You also can create standalone apps that simply extend what Teams already does.

Some apps are simple (send coworkers notifications), while others are complex (view patient records). When planning your app, remember that Teams is a collaboration hub. The best Teams apps help people express themselves and work better together.

* **Collaborate on everything in the same place**: A core benefit of Teams apps is pulling information somewhere outside Teams into a conversation. For example, your app can help people retrieve data in another tool or share rich, easily digestible content without ever leaving Teams.

* **More talk, more action**: Conversations often result in the need to do something (create an order, review my code, etc.). Your app can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

* **Notify others of important events**: Sick of sending reminders through email? Send notifications in Teams instead! Send notifications to users, a channel, the Activity Feed, or to anyone who subscribes to them.

* **Embed other sites and services**: Sometimes you just need to make things easier to find. Display your existing single-page app or webpage in Teams.

## How do people use Teams apps?

Apps can be used by individuals, a small group, or an entire organization. People discover and use apps through a set of standard Teams capabilities, including tabs, messaging extensions, and bots. Build your app with one or all of these capabilities.

      Tabs are a dedicated, full-screen web experience for static and dynamic information.

      ***Examples of tabs***

      * Display your company's internal homepage.
      * View dashboards from another app or service.
      * Provide a form commonly used by your team.

      Messaging extensions are shortcuts for sharing rich, interactive content and completing tasks in a conversation.

      ***Examples of messaging extensions***

      * Book a meeting with everyone in a chat.
      * Search for a customer order and share with a peer.
      * Share custom GIFs and stickers.

      * Connect people with IT support.
      * Answer common questions (FAQs).
