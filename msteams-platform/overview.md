# What are Microsoft Teams apps?

Microsoft Teams is a collaboration workspace in Office 365 that integrates with apps and services people use to get work done together. The Microsoft Teams developer platform makes it easy for developers to integrate their own apps and services to improve productivity, make decisions faster, provide focus (by reducing context switching), and create collaboration around existing content and workflows. Apps built on the Microsoft Teams platform are bridges between the Teams client and your services and workflows; bringing them directly into the context of your collaboration platform.

## What can Teams apps do?

Microsoft Teams apps primarily focus on increasing collaboration and improving productivity. Your app can be something simple, like posting notifications from an external source, or a complex multi-faceted tool. Just remember that Teams is a social collaboration platform; the best apps help people express themselves and work better together.

* **Collaborate on everything in the same place**: A core benefit of Teams apps is pulling information somewhere outside Teams into a conversation. For example, your app can push notifications into chats, allow people to search for data in another app, or share content in a way that's easily digestible.

* **More talk, more action**: Conversations often result in the need to take action (create an order, review my code, etc.). Your app can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

* **Notify others of important events**: Sick of sending reminders through email? Send notifications in Teams instead! Send notifications directly to users, a channel, the Activity Feed, or to anyone who subscribes to them.

* **Embed other sites and services**: Sometimes you just need to make things easier to find. Simply display your existing single-page app or webpage in Teams.

## How do people use Teams apps?

People can use your app with one or all of the following Teams capabilities (depending on how complex your app is).
