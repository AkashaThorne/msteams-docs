# Build and run your first Microsoft Teams app

You can jump right into Microsoft Teams platform development by quickly building and running a "Hello, world!" app. Learn how to 

## Prerequisites

1. [Microsoft 365 developer account](/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or Teams account that allows you to sideload an app. 
1. [Enable Teams developer preview mode](/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro#enable-developer-preview)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

  <summary>Not sure if your account allow you to sideload an app? Click here.</summary>
Click on AppStore on the bottom left corner and you should see "Upload a custom app" if sideloading is turned on.

If sideloading is not turned on for your tenant, please get a Microsoft 365 developer account and turn on sideloading by following [these steps](/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#Enable-custom-Teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)

## Build with Visual Studio Code

Follow these steps to create your new Teams project:

1. Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Set up a project with Visual Studio Code

Follow these steps to set up your first Teams app project using Visual Studio Code.

1. Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
1. Create a workspace/folder for your project in your local environment.
1. In Visual Studio Code, select the Teams icon ![Teams icon](../assets/icons/favicon-16x16.png) from the activity bar on the left.
1. Select **Create a new Teams app** from the command menu.
1. When prompted, enter the name of the workspace . This will be used as both the name of the folder where your project will reside, and the default name of your app.
1. Press **Enter** and you will arrive at the **Add capabilities** screen configure the properties for your new app.
1. Select **Tab** and then **Personal tab**

Now you have a personal tab running in Teams.

## Let's take a deeper look

Now that you have your first app up and running. Let's examine the essential files found in the Toolkit template.

### The app manifest

The app manifest file specifies the your app's attributes and points to required the resources for your solution. The manifest has a number of fields and properties that you can surface to create an amazing app experience. Here are the sections of the app manifest that integrate personal/static tabs and group/configurable tabs with Teams:

### Personal tab

```json
"staticTabs": [
    {
      "entityId": "unique Id for the page entity",
      "scopes": [
        "personal"
      ],
      "name": "Display name of tab",
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)",
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser"
    }
  ]
```

### Configurable tab

```json
"configurableTabs": [
    {
      "configurationUrl": "https://contoso.com/teamstab/configure",
      "scopes": [
        "team",
        "groupchat"
      ],
      "canUpdateConfiguration": true,
      "sharePointPreviewImage": "Relative path to a tab preview image for use in SharePoint â€” 1024px X 768",
      "supportedSharePointHosts": "Define how your tab wil be made available in SharePoint (full page or web part)"
    }
  ]
```

The app manifest file is also a major component of the Teams app package:

|Data|Type|Size|Manifest location|Toolkit file name|
|---|---|:---:|:---:|-----|
|âœ” **app manifest**|.json| â€” | â€” |.publish/**manifest.json**|
|âœ”**color logo**|.png|192&times;192 pixels|`icon.color`|.publish/**color.png**|
|âœ”**outline logo**|.png|32&times;32 pixels|``icon.outline`|.publish/**outline.png**|

### App.js

The app.js file â€” src/components/app.js â€” handles the initialization and routing of your app and most importantly, reaches out to the Microsoft Teams SDK. This critical call establishes communication between your app and Teams:

```javascript
microsoftTeams.initialize(window);
```

The `MicrosoftTeams.(initialize)`  function must be called before any other [Teams SDK API](../tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md) calls. A tab in Microsoft Teams displays the specified web app within an **iframe** in the Microsoft Teams client. This call must be made after the iframe has loaded successfully.

### Tab.js

The Tab.js file â€” **src/components/Tab.js** â€” renders the main tab content
 for your app in the personal scope. For instance, your tab might require contextual information to display relevant content such as basic information about the user, team, or company. You can retrieve context information by calling the Microsoft Teams SDK `microsoftTeams.getContext(function(context) { /* ... */ })`.

### TabConfig,js

The TabConfig.js file â€” **src/components/TabConfig.js** â€” renders the content for your channel tab and displays a configuration experience for the user when the tab is added to a channel. You can use the configuration page defined in the manifest to collect any configuration information the web app might need to customize the information shown in the tab. Similar to a personal tab, the content displayed in a channel tab is displayed in an **iframe**. 

The URL loaded in the iframe is defined by the contentUrl property that's specified on the configuration page:

```javascript
microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({"contentUrl": "https://localhost:3000/tab"})
```

The [setValidityState](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/microsoftteams.settings?view=msteams-client-js-latest#setvaliditystate-boolean-) must be set to true so that your users can save the settings that they want in your tab:

```javascript
microsoftTeams.settings.setValidityState(true);
```
