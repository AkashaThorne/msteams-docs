# Learn how to build your first Teams app

A Teams app is made up of platform capabilities, UI elements, and backend services. If you're in a hurry and want to know what building a real-world Teams app is like, follow our **Build your first app** tutorials.

Some what of what you'll learn includes:

## Get up and running quickly with the Teams Toolkit

The Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code takes care of creating your app project and scaffolding so you can have a running app in minutes.

## Define your app with the manifest

The manifest is a blueprint where you specify the capabilities and services your Teams app uses.

## Scope your audience

You can build a Teams app for personal use or collaboration. In the tutorials, you'll learn how build a tab for individual users or a group of people in a channel or chat.

* Switch your app's color theme when the Teams client theme changes
* Provide users options to configure their app experience
