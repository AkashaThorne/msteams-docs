# Understanding Teams app capabilities

*Capabilities* are the extension points that allow you to build custom apps on the Microsoft Teams platform. All apps are unique: Some may only have one capability (such as a connector), while others have many.

As you get more familiar with Teams app development, you'll notice you can build out capabilities in different ways to accomplish the same thing. For example, if your app requires user input, you could embed an existing web form in a tab using an `<iframe>`. You could do something similar in a tab using a task module, which is a common Teams interface.

See the following illustration to get an idea which capabilities would provide the features you want in your app.
