# Designing cards

What's a card, particularly an Adaptive Card (1-2 sentences)? (Provides rich communication, including unfurled links.)

Where do people interact with cards? (Personal, chat, and channels; with any capability)

## Adaptive Cards

Description + screenshots.

Link to adaptivecard.io

### Adaptive Card layouts

Examples: Only text, single image, carousel of images, horizontal scroll etc. (TODO: what is the most common layout)

When to use each layout  

Sketch file + GitHub code link  

Have a download all for all sketch files

### Adaptive Card interactions

Where the button can lead to.

Sign in/sign out (showing “sign in” not the actual experience) – sketch files + templates.

Task modules  

Refresh card/real-time update (eg. Polly).

### Adaptive Card constraints

Example: Buttons are at the bottom.

## Other types of cards

Provide descriptions + example scenarios/screenshots (e.g., thumbnails, hero, sign in, Graph cards?).

(Use what you can from these topics: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.)

## Card collections

Provide descriptions + example scenarios/screenshots

Messages, cards, task modules.

Could possibly structure as steps a designer can follow.
