# Designing a meeting extension notification modal

Notification modals display on the Teams meeting stage and require simple interactions. They're a subtle way to capture input that isn't distracting and keeps the meeting flowing.

## Use cases

You might create a notification modal so users can:

* Provide brief feedback
* Take a short survey
* Get reminders

### Example

The following example shows what a notification modal might look like from the perspective of a meeting participant.
