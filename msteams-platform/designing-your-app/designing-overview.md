# Designing your Microsoft Teams app

Well-designed Microsoft Teams apps make conversations smoother and more meaningful, focus on core activities, and are inclusive and accessible.

These guidelines include the toolkits, UI samples, and best practices for designing an experience that feels native to Teams and, most importantly, helps people collaborate and be productive.

> [!NOTE]
> These guidelines are primarily for designing desktop apps.

## Creating a cohesive look and feel

Apps extend Teams features and functionality with one or more available platform [capabilities](../concepts/capabilities-overview.md). Your app can present these capabilities—whether it's a tab, messaging extension, bot, or webhook—with UI components seen in common web apps and others specifically geared for Teams.

Designing your app requires understanding what UI works for capabilities and what doesn't. For example, while multi-level navigation works for most websites, it isn't an ideal experience in a Teams tab.

Capabilities: ME, Webhook and connectors, Bot, Tab, cards & task modules

Explain how, depending on the Teams capabilities your app is using, your design may need to thread several standard Teams design components together.

## Before you begin

To design a great app, you need a fundamental understanding of what your app will be and how people will use it. Make sure you know your app's use cases, understand how those fit in with available capabilities, and determine if the app is for groups or individuals before opening your design tools.
