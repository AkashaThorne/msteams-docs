# Designing your Microsoft Teams app

Well-designed Microsoft Teams apps make conversations smoother and more meaningful, focus on core activities, and are inclusive and accessible.

These guidelines include the toolkits, UI samples, and best practices for designing an experience that feels native to Teams and, most importantly, helps people collaborate and be productive.

> [!NOTE]
> These guidelines are primarily for designing desktop apps.

## Before you begin

You can't design a great app without a fundamental understanding of what your app will be and how people will use it. Before opening your design tools, make sure you know your app's use cases, understand how those fit with Teams capabilities, and determine if the app will be used by groups, individuals, or both.

## Creating a cohesive look and feel

Apps extend Teams features and functionality with one or more available platform [capabilities](../concepts/capabilities-overview.md). Your app can present these capabilities—whether it's a tab, messaging extension, bot, or webhook—with UI components seen in common web apps and others specifically geared for Teams.

Designing your app requires understanding what UI works for certain capabilities (and what doesn't). For example, while multi-level navigation works for most websites, it isn't an ideal experience in a Teams tab.

Along those lines, your design must thread UI components together in a way that feels natural not only to users but also within Teams. This is especially true if your app has more than one capability.

### Tabs

       Tabs are canvases for web-based content. But unlike a standard web app or website, they work best when displaying a small set of data or tasks.
