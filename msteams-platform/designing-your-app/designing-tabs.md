# Designing tabs

Tabs are a simple way to surface content in your app by essentially embedding a webpage in Teams.

## Tab audiences

With tabs, your user may be one person (personal tab) or a group (channel tab). While it may not change your design, knowing your app's scope could influence your design.

## Tab layouts

Here are some common tab layouts.

### Single canvas

This is one large area where work gets done. OneNote and Wiki follow this pattern. If you have an app that doesn’t separate content into smaller components this would be a good fit.

### List

Lists are great for sorting and filtering large quantities of data and are great at keeping the most important things at the top. It is helpful to use sortable columns. Actions can be added to each list item under the ellipsis menu.

### Column

Columns are great for workflows that move an item from one column to another to indicate a new status. Consider supporting drag and drop for those scenarios. We recommend using dialogs or inline expansion for detail views.

### Grid

Grids are useful for showing elements which are highly visual. It helps to include a filter or search control at the top.

## Tab setup experiences
