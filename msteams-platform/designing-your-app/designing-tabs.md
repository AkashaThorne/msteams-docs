# Designing tabs

Designing a tab for Teams tabs is similar to designing a single-page application or website. The best tabs are simple, task oriented, and facilitate collaboration.

## Tab audiences

With tabs, your user may be one person (personal tab) or a group (channel tab). While it may not matter, knowing your app's scope could influence your design.

## Tab layouts

Here are some common tab layouts.

### Single canvas

This is a single large area where work gets done. OneNote and Wiki follow this pattern. If your app that doesn’t separate content into smaller components this would be a good fit.

### List

Lists are great for sorting and filtering large quantities of data and are great at keeping the most important things at the top. It is helpful to use sortable columns. Actions can be added to each list item under the ellipsis menu.

### Column

Columns are great for workflows that move an item from one column to another to indicate a new status. Consider supporting drag and drop for those scenarios. We recommend using dialogs or inline expansion for detail views.

### Grid

Grids are useful for showing elements which are highly visual. It helps to include a filter or search control at the top.

## Tab setup experiences

For onboarding and auth workflows.

Tab configuration design – have sketch files + templates

Sign in/sign out – sketch files + templates

Empty state/welcome screen – best practices + sketch files

Discuss cards and task modules, including links to respective design guidelines.

## Best practices

Use these as checklists when designing your app.

### Dos

* **Focus functionality** to only your app's use cases. (Teams isn't the World Wide Web.)
* **Know your audience**. Your user may be one person (personal tab) or a group (channel tab), which could influence your design.
* **Notify users of tab activity**. For example, post cards to a channel when someone creates a ticket on the issue-tracking tab.
* **Include a default state** even if users can configure some aspects of the experience.
* **Be a deep link target** from elsewhere in Teams. For example, a card may show a summary of bug data, but selecting it shows the entire bug in a tab.
* **Give the tab a useful name**. While your app's name may stand out in AppSource, consider naming the tab simply based on what it can do.

### Don'ts

* **Avoid tabs within tabs**, such as multiple panels, layers of navigation, or vertical and horizontal scrolling.
